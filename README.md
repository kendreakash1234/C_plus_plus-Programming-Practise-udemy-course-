"Collection of C++ programs covering Data Structures, Algorithms, and problem-solving practice."
# C++ DSA Practice

This repository contains my C++ programs focused on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).  
It includes solutions to standard problems, coding challenges, and concepts such as:

- Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists
- Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming and Greedy Algorithms
- Bit Manipulation
- STL (Standard Template Library)
- Interview-style problem sets

### ðŸš€ Purpose
To improve problem-solving skills in C++, prepare for technical interviews, and document my learning journey in DSA.

### ðŸ“Œ Tools & Language
- Language: C++
- IDEs: Qt Creator / online C++ compiler / Code::Blocks
- OS: Windows
